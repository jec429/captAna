/// A base class for classes which specify how to set up an Analysis format
/// output tree, and fill it. These classes will be read in and run by the
/// oaAnalysis package software, namely by TAnalysisLoop.  The classes must be
/// accompanied by tests to check that they work, and runtime tests to see if
/// they are appropriate for the input root files being used.
///
/// A note on naming of data members in analysis modules classes and their
/// sub-classes:
/// 
///  * The names of members belonging to the modules themselves all start with
///    an 'f' to indicate that they are fields in the classes. These names are
///    used in coding up the modules, so it is better that they follow the
///    convention.
///   
///  * The members of storage sub-classes for the modules, which get saved in
///    TTrees within TClonesArrays, DO NOT get an 'f' at the beginning,
///    because they represent names that get used directly in output trees.
///   
///  * The modules themselves get saved in the output files, including their
///    data members (except those with a comment with an exclamation mark
///    "//!"  after them, which tells ROOT not to save them). These can be
///    accessed in the analysis macros, but since they are explicitly members
///    of the module classes, it is consistent to have them start with 'f'
///    too.
